# Terrain_CFD

The aim of Rotor CFD is to aid in the identification of sorces aerodynamic rotor generated by winds flowing over mountains. Rotor poses a majour hazaed for paragliding and can be difficult to identify from the ground. This simulation is capable of rendering smoke trails volumetrically to visualise turbulent air currents.

## Curent Progress

- A stable Eulerian integration scheme has been implemented using the red-black Gauss Seidel method. All simulation steps are performed using Vulkan compute shaders.
- Volumetric rendering has been implimented within a fragment shader for smoke visualisation.
- A rasteriser generates the view of the terrain mesh from real word lidar data.
